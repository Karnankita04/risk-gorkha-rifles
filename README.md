# 🎯 RISK

Welcome to the official repository of **Risk**, developed by the **Gorkha Rifles** team.. This is a game where players battle for global domination through strategic planning, diplomacy, and tactical warfare.

## 🎮 About the Game

This is a digital adaptation of the classic **Risk** board game — a turn-based strategy game where 3 to 6 players compete to dominate the world map through tactical troop deployment, territorial conquest, and smart alliances.
Each player takes turns to reinforce their armies, launch attacks on opponents, and fortify their territories. The game blends chance (via dice-based combat) with skillful planning, negotiation, and map control.

Our version adds:

- Real-time multiplayer support
- Interactive map visuals
- In-game chat and stat tracking
- A customizable lobby for private games

## 📋 Game rules

- Players reinforce their armies at the start of their turn.
- Players may attack neighboring enemy territories using dice.
- Successful attacks may result in territory capture and card rewards.
- Players can fortify troops between connected territories.
- The last player remaining wins.
